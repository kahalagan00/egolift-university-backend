# Egolift University

## Description

Egolift University is an all-in-one platform where beginners and fitness enthusiasts can learn fitness concepts and 
monitor their progress. The overall scope of the platform is focused on the three resistance training styles: bodybuilding, 
calisthenics, and powerlifting. The primary front-facing application will be in mobile platforms (Android & iOS), which 
people can easily use while they are at the gym or their choice of place for their workouts.

- My motivation for this application is to provide a more tailored resource for people who are primarily interested in
  bodybuilding, calisthenics, and powerlifting. As a big fan of resistance training, I believe that these three
  training styles can and should be learned together as they have a lot of intersections.
- I am currently building this project with the hope of helping people out there in the world reach their fitness goals,
  and also practice Full Stack development technologies that are popular.
